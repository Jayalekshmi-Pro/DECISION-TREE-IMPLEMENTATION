Objective:
The primary objective of this task is to build, train, and visualize a Decision Tree model using the Scikit-learn library in Python. The model will be used to perform classification or prediction on a selected dataset. You are expected to understand and demonstrate how decision trees operate, how they split data based on features, and how they make decisions to predict outcomes. The task also includes visualizing the constructed decision tree, evaluating its performance, and interpreting the results. The final output should be a well-documented Jupyter Notebook that includes the full pipeline — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

Overview:
A Decision Tree is one of the simplest and most interpretable machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. It works by learning simple decision rules inferred from the features of the data. Each internal node of the tree represents a test on a feature, each branch corresponds to the outcome of that test, and each leaf node represents a final decision or prediction.
In this task, you will implement a Decision Tree model using the popular Scikit-learn machine learning library. You will train it on a real-world dataset (such as the Iris dataset, Titanic survival data, or any dataset from open sources like UCI or Kaggle) and visualize how the model makes decisions.

Scope of Work:

 1. Dataset Selection and Preparation:

    Choose a dataset that is suitable for classification. Some popular choices include:Iris flower classification ,Titanic survival            prediction ,Diabetes prediction ,Heart disease classification

    Load the dataset using libraries like Pandas or Scikit-learn datasets module.Perform necessary data preprocessing, such as:Handling        missing values ,Encoding categorical variables ,Feature selection or scaling (if required),Splitting the data into training and            testing sets

2. Model Building with Scikit-learn:

    Use Scikit-learn’s DecisionTreeClassifier to build the model.Configure parameters such as:criterion (e.g., "gini" or                       "entropy"),max_depth, min_samples_split, and other hyperparameters ,Train the model using the training dataset,Use the train               model,make predictions on the test data.

3. Model Evaluation:

   Evaluate the performance of the decision tree using metrics such as:Accuracy,Confusion matrix ,Precision, recall, F1-score,Analyze         underfitting or overfitting using training and test accuracy comparison.

4. Model Visualization:
 
   Visualize the decision tree using:plot_tree() from sklearn.tree ,export_text() for a text-based summary ,Optionally, use Graphviz for      enhanced tree diagrams ,Interpret the structure of the tree to understand how decisions are made.

5. Analysis and Discussion:

   Explain how the tree splits the data and what features are most influential.Analyze the depth of the tree and how pruning (limiting        depth or node size) affects performance.Discuss limitations and strengths of decision trees in classification tasks.

Expected Deliverables:

   A Jupyter Notebook that includes:Dataset loading and preprocessing ,Model training and prediction ,Model evaluation using various          classification metrics,Decision tree visualization (graphical and/or textual),Analytical discussion of results and model behavior

Learning Outcomes:

Understand the fundamental concepts behind decision trees and how they function.Gain practical experience in using Scikit-learn to implement machine learning models.Learn how to evaluate classification models using confusion matrix and accuracy scores.
Understand the importance of visualizations in interpreting machine learning models.Develop skills in presenting machine learning workflows in a structured and documented notebook format.
